# Sky Seal 10

## Description

The year is 2039. Humanity has grown heavily reliant on an ultra-secure satellite network known as SkyNet Quantum Link.
But disaster strikes: a critical node, Satellite #10 – Sky Seal, suddenly goes dark.

A cybersecurity analyst team uncovers that an automatic lockdown has been triggered.
To restore access, a valid authentication key must be regenerated.

Your objective is to analyze the binary file, understand the internal logic, and reconstruct the legitimate key that will restore access to the satellite’s data systems.

Time is critical.
The longer Sky Seal 10 stays offline, the greater the risk of downstream system collapse.

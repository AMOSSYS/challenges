# The Silent Packets

## Description

April 2025 â€“ In a sensitive maritime surveillance context, one of our autonomous drones operating offshore experienced a critical security incident.

This drone was remotely operated via a satellite link and was equipped with an onboard Linux system integrating both OT and IT layers, including a web-based supervision server for operators.

Log data shows that the drone temporarily:
- lost its GPS connection,
- experienced partial communication jamming,
- and most notably: an unknown kernel module was dynamically loaded.
